fixes:
  - The oslo.db context manager returned by ``db.api.get_context_manager()``
    will be configured with flush_on_subtransaction=True to more closely
    match the behavior of the previous session.begin(subtransactions=True)
    pattern we used everywhere before. See bug 1664643 for more details.
