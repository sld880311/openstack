features:
  - A new fixture for testing with neutron-lib API definitions has
    been added as ``neutron_lib.fixtures.APIDefinitionFixture``. This
    fixture can be used anytime extension plugins are being tested
    that modify resource attribute maps and ensures the single global
    API definition attribute map is copied and restored.
  - The ``neutron_lib.api.extensions.APIExtensionDescriptor`` class now
    defines update_attributes_map that uses the API definitions attribute
    map if none is given. This is the default behavior in most all
    extensions today and thus is collapsed into the base class for convenience.
