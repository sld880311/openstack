 Testing
=========

The preferred way to run the unit tests is using ``tox``. There are multiple
test targets that can be run to validate the code.

``tox -e pep8``

  Style guidelines enforcement.

``tox -e py27``

  Traditional unit testing.

``tox -e functional``

  Live functional testing against an existing OpenStack instance.

Functional testing assumes the existence of a `clouds.yaml` file as supported
by `os-client-config <https://docs.openstack.org/os-client-config/latest>`__
It assumes the existence of a cloud named `devstack` that behaves like a normal
DevStack installation with a demo and an admin user/tenant - or clouds named
`functional_admin` and `functional_nonadmin`.
